To test the functionality of this component run the GreenAmpt Test.cs.  
This supplies sample input values and outputs the result to the Output window.
	
	The finish method utilizes the new functionality of the SMW.Utilities class, by loading the
results into ODM.  The default properties required to load into ODM are:
						_server = "CE-51\\SQLEXPRESS"
						_database = "OD"
						_user = "sa"
						_password = "sa"
						_file = ""	
						_log = "log.txt"
Change these to reflect your system, by setting them within Finish().
	
	
	Two addtional projects are included for debugging purposes, Numerics and SMW.
The purpose of the Numerics project is to assist in solving the Infiltration equation.
