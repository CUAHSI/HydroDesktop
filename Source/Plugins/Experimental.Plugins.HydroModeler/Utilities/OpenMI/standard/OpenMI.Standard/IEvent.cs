    /// perform monitoring tasks such as logging, tracing, or online visualization. Linkable components
    /// must generate events to which other linkable components or tools can subscribe. In this way, it 
    /// becomes possible to implement these generic tools without requiring any knowledge of the specific 
    /// tools in the components themselves. By adopting the OpenMI event types, system developers can use 
    /// those tools without additional effort. Note that the event mechanism should not be used to pass 
    /// data sets. Data sets should be retrieved through the GetValues() call.</para>

    /// thread, as the computation process of an entire model chain is rather autonomous and not 
    /// controlled by any master controller. Once a component receives the thread, it must send an 
    /// event, so listeners (e.g. a GUI) can grab and hold the thread, and thus pause the computation 
    /// by not returning control. In normal conditions, the control is returned so the component can 
    /// continue its computation. Of course the computation is also controlled at the level that 
    /// triggers the first component of the chain by means of a GetValues()-call. Stop firing those 
    /// calls will also result in a paused system, although it may take a while before an entire call 
    /// stack completes its processing activity.</para>
