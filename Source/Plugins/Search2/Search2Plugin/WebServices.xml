    <aabstract>Monitoring at the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge has been aimed at creating the monitoring infrastructure needed to more accurately assess sediment and nutrient loads entering and leaving Mud Lake, and providing managers with the data and information needed to better understand how Mud Lake affects the sediment and nutrient loads within the system. Continuous water quality monitoring equipment has been installed at 4 sites around the periphery of Mud Lake to monitor the water quality of its major inflows and outflows. These sites include: 1) the Rainbow Inlet Canal where it flows into Mud Lake; 2) the causeway at the north end of Bear Lake where Bear River Water enters Bear Lake from Mud Lake; 3) the Lifton pumping station where water is pumped out of Bear Lake; and 4) the Outlet Canal where water from Bear Lake and Mud Lake leaves the complex and flows North and back into the Bear River. Continuous flow measurements at these locations have been provided by PacifiCorp Energy using existing equipment at those sites.  Utah State University has worked together with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to collect these data.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>For thousands of years, the San Diego River has provided life to our community.  While it is known as "California's First River," in recent years the River has been neglected and largely ignored.  The River Park Foundation is endeavoring to bring people together to work for a healthy river, to protect significant natural and cultural resources, and to celebrate the River with a river-long park system.

Through volunteer programs, outreach activities and specific projects, thousands of people are coming together to make a difference. </aabstract>

    <aabstract>The datasets have been collected as part of two projects, NASA-NIP-00050655 and NSF-EAR-0337277 (co-PI Wendy Graham, Jennifer Jacobs, and Jim Jones). Both the CRWR and UF NSF hydrology projects benefit from such data exchanges. 

We have conducted 6 experiments - MicroWEX-1 through MicroWEX-6, three for corn and three for cotton seasons. The datasets provide detailed water and energy balance measurements along with concurrent remote sensing (microwave) signatures of the growing vegetation. The soil and vegetation sampling protocols that were followed ensure that the datasets can be used for interdisciplinary studies, by hydrologists, agronomists and agricultural engineers, and remote sensing scientists.
The detailed experimental reports are available online at http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AE360. This link is for the MicroWEX-2 and contains embedded links to take you to other reports. The two most recent reports are yet to be linked, but are available at
http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AE407 and http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AE409.

Based upon what you had said in your email and my meeting with Wendy, you need a sample data to help you showcase the conceptual model for the HIS project in time for your meeting on Sept 12. It does not matter for the HIS project which season/crop we provide you with. If that is true, I would suggest that we provide you with datasets for corn seasons.  Is one season of corn enough or would you like more than one season?

My reason for choosing corn even though Fei was involved in the cotton experiment (MicroWEX-6) is because the datasets from corn have been processed thoroughly (we are still analyzing the microwave brightness observations and will not be able to provide those) during our model development. The cotton datasets haven't been looked at as closely as I would have hoped and I am uncomfortable showcasing something that has not gone through rigorous quality check. Quality checking will take significant time and we will not be able to meet the Sept 12 deadline.
ALL data storage are completely standardized and Fei knows the structure well, so I don't forsee any problems with using corn for your HIS project.

I would also like to inform Fei that all the MicroWEX data are intellectual property of the Center for Remote Sensing/University of Florida and are not be used without permission of the project PIs.

    <aabstract>The National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) is a nationwide network of precipitation monitoring sites. The network is a cooperative effort between many different groups, including the State Agricultural Experiment Stations, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and numerous other governmental and private entities. The NADP/NTN has grown from 22 stations at the end of 1978, our first year, to over 250 sites spanning the continental United States, Alaska, and Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The purpose of the network is to collect data on the chemistry of precipitation for monitoring of geographical and temporal long-term trends. The precipitation at each station is collected weekly according to strict clean-handling procedures. It is then sent to the Central Analytical Laboratory where it is analyzed for hydrogen (acidity as pH), sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride, and base cations (such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium).

    <aabstract>Following the guidelines laid out in the Neuse River Prototype, the proposed structure of the proposed observatory has two basic elements:

1) The SRB hydrologic Observing System is formed as a network of testbeds covering the major physiographic regions of the SRB and designed to make nested observations of water, energy and mass.
2) Cross-cutting science themes will link and synthesize observations across the watershed network and allow a more holistic hydrologic understanding and predictive capability at all scales relevant to the river basin.

    <aabstract>Priority instream flow studies under the Texas Instream Flow Program (TIFP) were selected
based on potential or planned water development projects, water rights permitting issues, and
other factors. A study on the lower Sabine River was prioritized1 based on the potential for
water transfers within the Sabine Basin, proposed inter-basin water transfer projects, and
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hydropower relicensing of the Toledo Bend Dam.
The Lower Sabine River Priority Instream Flow Study was initiated in September 2004 with the
Reconnaissance and Information Evaluation2 phase – the first step of a study under the TIFP.
The purpose of the Reconnaissance and Information Evaluation phase, according to the TIFP
Technical Overview, is to compile, review, and geo-reference available studies and data,
identify historic and current conditions, identify significant issues and concerns, and conduct
preliminary field surveys and analysis. During reconnaissance, the Sabine River Authority of
Texas (SRA-TX) compiled a bibliography of information related to the Sabine River from the
Toledo Bend Dam to the mouth of the Sabine River at the north end of Sabine Lake.
Biological data compiled during reconnaissance included benthic macro-invertebrate and fish
data sets from rapid bio-assessments of many of the main tributary streams of the Sabine River
in Texas through a basin-wide effort that began in 1993 to characterize the biological community
of the priority subwatersheds of the Sabine River Basin. Biological data has also been collected
from the main stem of the river for specific studies but not as a basin-wide effort. Most main
stem biological data is from a benthic macro-invertebrate monitoring contract with a local
industry from 1989-1992 and from some Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)
fish collection work near Anacoco Bayou in 2003.
An analysis of the bibliography compiled during reconnaissance revealed a lack of recent
biological data for the main stem of the lower Sabine River. In order to have a more complete
biological set, a study under Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Contract No.
0604830567 between the TWDB and the SRA-TX was funded by a TWDB Research and
Planning Fund Research Grant.
Collections and habitat assessments were made at eight sites beginning May 2006 through
September 2006 by staff from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, TCEQ, TWDB, and SRATX.
The magnitude of the effect of Hurricane Rita and the drought of early spring 2006 on the
diversity and population of species collected has not yet been assessed. Additional sampling is
proposed to mitigate any seasonal or equipment bias as well as to further assess the effects of
the hurricane and the drought.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>Because of greater demands for fresh water by growing communities like San Antonio, the Texas Legislature has directed Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), in cooperation with other appropriate governmental agencies such as the San Antonio River Authority (SARA), to conduct an instream flow data collection effort. This instream flow collection effort will help determine appropriate flow and habitat conditions necessary to support a sound ecological environment for resident fish species and will help to gain a better understanding of the fish assemblage dynamics within the Lower San Antonio River (SAR) watershed. The Lower SAR watershed was selected as a priority study reach based on the potential for significant reuse of water and the uncertainty of future water development strategies. Methodologies for determining appropriate flow conditions necessary to support a sound ecological environment will also be studied.
SARA field personnel have assisted the State of Texas Agency Staff with reconnaissance, sample site selection, biological and habitat sampling as well as data collection efforts throughout the Lower SAR and Lower Cibolo Creek watersheds. Evaluation of the fish community, flow measurements and habitat assessments were conducted at five sites on the Lower SAR (Loop 1604 in Bexar County, Floresville City Park in Wilson County, Conquista Crossing in Karnes County, SH 72 in Karnes County, and Riverdale Rd. in Goliad County) and three sites on the Lower Cibolo Creek (FM 539 in Wilson County, FM 537 in Wilson County and FM 389 in Karnes County). Data collected from these sampling efforts will provide much needed habitat and baseline data of the fish community composition within the lower SAR watershed. Collection methods included boat and backpack electrofishing as well as seining efforts in as many habitat types as possible. Individual biological collection efforts were segregated by habitat types from which the samples were collected. Photographs and global positioning system coordinates were recorded from the mid-point of each habitat type. Measurements were made of the average habitat depth, dominant substrate, and current velocity within each habitat type.
Data collected from this effort will help to characterize current instream flow conditions within the Lower SAR watershed and will help to make future flow management recommendations needed to sustain the resident biological community and ensure an adequate water supply for the future needs of all communities within the Lower SAR watershed. The instream flow methodologies that result from this effort will influence the approach that SARA will undertake in the future concerning water related endeavors.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>This research is conducted o study the effectiveness of conservation practices at the watershed scale using data from an extensively researched watershed. The second is to examine how watershed restoration in a mixed-land use watershed can be optimized by considering its biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics. To show why (or why not) conservation practices are effective at the watershed scale with emphasis on statistical analysis of existing monitoring data, geo-spatial modeling, and integrated physical and socio-economic analyses. Our research includes an outreach plan for information transfer and data storage and retrieval.

The Paradise Creek datasets use the standard topic code of "inlandWaters" (012) which describes inland water features, drainage systems and characteristics in particular water quality and stream flow.  It is published in conjunction with the ICEWATER (INRA Water Resources Consortium Constellation of Experimental Watersheds Network)</aabstract>

These nine rivers account for approximately 93% of the streamflow entering Chesapeake Bay from the non-tidal part of its watershed. Results of the RIM program are being used by resource managers, policy makers, and concerned citizens to help evaluate the effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing nutrients and sediment entering Chesapeake Bay from its tributaries.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>Restoration efforts that remove non-native understory vegetation or dense monotypic stands of non-native vegetation from riparian zones (the bosque) are designed to reduce consumption of water. Quantification of the response of evapotranspiration (ET) and water table depths to non-native understory removal or to eradication of dense stands of non-native species like salt cedar or Russian olive is needed to provide defensible estimates of potential water-savings from restoration activities. In addition to restoration assessment, it is also important to monitor the effects the increasing roles of fire and post-burn management have on ET and water tables. We monitored the ET and water table responses of a site with understory removed (Albuquerque South Valley).

    <aabstract>This data service provides data collected from Jemez River Basin sites. 
We are developing an interdisciplinary observatory in the southwestern US that will improve our fundamental understanding of the function, structure and co-evolution of biota, soils, and landforms that comprise the Critical Zone (CZ). The observatory is designed as a natural laboratory for the earth science community to test hypotheses related to CZ function in relation to climatic and water cycle variation. We posit that CZ systems organize and evolve in response to open system fluxes of energy and mass that can be quantified at point to watershed scales. These fluxes include meteoric CZ inputs of radiation, water, and carbon that are modulated by surficial biota to produce fluids and biogeochemical components that undergo biotic and abiotic transformation during gradient-driven transport. We hypothesize that the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is related specifically and predictably to the timing and magnitude of these fluxes. Therefore, our CZ Observatory (CZO) is designed to examine the impacts of space-time variability in energy and water flux on coupled CZ processes along two well-constrained climate gradients. The first is on rhyolitic parent material in the Jemez River Basin of northern New Mexico (JRB) and the second is on granite and schist bedrock within the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona (SCM). Measurement, modeling, and experimentation at sites that vary in parent rock, elevation, aspect, slope, soil development, and vegetation will enable quantification of the feedbacks between energy and mass fluxes (driven by chemical and physical gradients) and measured components of CZ structure. Our team has developed an iterative modeling and measurement strategy, and a management structure that fosters integration among disciplines. The JRB-SCM CZO is organized around broad questions that require an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach including the following two: How does variability in energy input and related mass flux influence CZ structure and function? How do feedbacks between landscape evolution and the cycling of water and carbon alter short- and long-term CZ development? To identify the couplings among physical, chemical, and biological processes, our research integrates four crosscutting science themes that are both multi-disciplinary and multi-scale: Ecohydrology and Hydrologic Partitioning, Subsurface Biogeochemistry, Landscape Evolution and Surface Water Dynamics. We are employing an integrated process-based modeling approach to (i) identify optimal sites for measuring structure and process, (ii) refine hypotheses developed through field-based observation and measurements, (iii) explore feedbacks and emergent system behaviors, and (iv) develop transfer functions that can be used to relate system behavior across scales and modes of observation. Discoveries made at the JRB-SCM CZO will improve our ability to predict CZ response to changes in climate and land cover, which is immediately useful to regional resource managers and will ultimately inform broader-scale decision making. We coordinate closely with other CZOs to support data collection, storage, and dissemination. Our education and outreach activities are built upon other highly effective educational efforts developed and led at UA. We are developing a range of products and activities for K-16 students, the general public, and stakeholders, including summer Observatory field experiences for local high school and undergraduate students, graduate courses, and field camps in earth science, as well as coordination of related efforts by other science centers active in the region. We invite new investigators throughout the global earth sciences community to conduct novel and collaborative research at the JRB-SCM CZO</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), located in the Front Range of Colorado, is designed to examine the effect of erosion on the development and function of the Critical Zone. The Critical Zone is the near-surface region that supports terrestrial life, extending vertically from the base of groundwater to the upper reaches of the vegetation canopy. The Boulder Creek Watershed is about 1160km2 and drains the Front Range from the Continental Divide (4120m) to the eastern plains (1480) (Murphy, 2000). In the upper reaches of Boulder Creek, it has 3 tributaries – North Boulder Creek, Middle Boulder Creek and South Boulder Creek. The confluence of North Boulder Creek and Middle Boulder Creek is at ?m. South Boulder Creek joins Boulder Creek near the City of Boulder. The large elevation range within the watershed encompasses five climatic zones – alpine, subalpine, montane, foothills and plains. Total annual precipitation generally decreases with elevation, from &gt;100cm at the Continental Divide to about 46cm near the City of Boulder. The project will focus on the upper basin of the Boulder Creek Watershed (above the City of Boulder).</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO) is located in Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico. The multi-disciplinary team of geoscientists working at the site are addressing a set of specific hypotheses that are related to the following overarching questions: How do critical zone processes and the flow and transformations of material differ in landscapes with contrasting bedrock but similar climates, land use, and geologic histories? What are the implications of these differences for the long term sustainability of water and soil resources? Research Overview Specifically, the observatory is quantifying and comparing critical zone (CZ) processes in landforms and watersheds underlain by three different rock types, granodiorites, volcaniclastics, and their associated contact metamorphic rocks. Previous research has demonstrated that these are some of the most rapidly eroding watersheds in the world. There are also dramatic, but poorly quantified, contrasts in CZ processes between areas underlain by these bedrocks. Individual research project include studies of deep weathering, soil formation and soil carbon accumulation, riparian zone dynamics, fluvial geomorphology, and meteorology. Infrastructure includes weather stations, instrumented soil pits and riparian zones, and stream flow gages. The principal researchers and students involve in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory are from the UPENN, the Pennsylvania State University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Puerto Rico, the US Geological Survey, and the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The Observatory will also provide facilities for collaborators from a host of US and International Universities and Research Centers</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Southern Sierra CZO is a community platform for research on critical-zone processes across the rain-snow transition in the mixed-conifer forest of the Southern Sierra Nevada. While this elevation range has characteristically rapid seasonal changes, going from snow cover to wet soil to dry soil over a 1-2 month period, climate warming will shift this transition period earlier or eliminate it entirely at the current transitional elevation. The characteristic spatial differences along gradients offer the opportunity to substitute space for time, making the CZO an excellent natural laboratory for studying how critical zone processes respond to perturbations, and particularly how the water cycle drives critical zone processes. A team of scientists from multiple institutions is carrying out research at the CZO, which is located in the Kings River Experimental Watershed (KREW), a U.S. Forest Service watershed-level, integrated ecosystem project for long-term research in headwater catchments in the Sierra National Forest.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) is a forested, small, temperate-climate catchment in central Pennsylvania in which the regolith is developing upon homogeneous shale. The purpose of the observatory and associated interdisciplinary research is to quantitatively predict the creation, evolution, and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphologic processes operating in a temperate, forested landscape. By creating an interdisciplinary team working collaboratively in one observatory we aim to advance methods for characterizing regolith, to provide a theoretical basis for predicting the distribution and properties of regolith, and to theoretically and experimentally study the impacts of regolith on fluid pathways, flow rates, and residence times. The research site, the focus of National Science Foundation-supported research since the 1970s, has comprehensive datasets on distributed water budgets (1970-75), has served as a model test bed for hydrological response (1998-present), and will be augmented here by new geochemical, geomorphological, ecological, lidar, and soils datasets, all available to the research community. Shale Hills CZO represents an opportunity to investigate the rates and mechanisms of saprolite and soil formation on a relatively simple but ubiquitous bedrock lithology that has been documented to be important in determining global fluxes of C, P, and platinum–group elements worldwide. Furthermore, the regolith at Shale Hills has experienced at least two potentially significant perturbations in the geologically recent past: a climatic perturbation from periglacial to modern conditions, and a biologic perturbation from anthropogenic clearing of forests during and repeatedly since colonial occupation. The magnitude of these perturbations and their influence on regolith generation afford an opportunity to assess the time scales of response of soil production to both long-term climate change and human activity.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>Spatial and temporal integration of carbon and mineral fluxes: a whole watershed approach to quantifying anthropogenic modification of critical zone carbon sequestration. Earth moving by humans associated with agriculture, urbanization, and excavation re-contours entire landscapes and constitutes a major geological force within the Critical Zone of planet Earth. The Critical Zone, defined as the terrestrial layer extending from tree tops through the groundwater and into stream networks, sustains most terrestrial life on the planet. At a greater rate than ever in Earth’s history, erosion and excavation expose sub-soil materials and unweathered minerals, which mix into and within soils and are transported as sediment loads through river networks, from headwaters to estuaries. To quantify the impacts on the global carbon cycle of humans as geological agents, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the University of Delaware (UD) and Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) will establish a Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) within the 1440 km2 Christina River drainage basin (CRB/CZO). Scientific investigations within the CRB/CZO, located in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Northern Delaware and straddling unglaciated Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, will test the following overarching hypothesis: Humans, by accelerating the introduction of minerals into biologically and chemically active zones, significantly enhance the interactions between minerals and organic matter and create globally significant impacts on the exchange of carbon between the land and the atmosphere. The human footprint within the CRB/CZO spans centuries, and current land uses include second-growth forests, agriculture, and suburban and urban development This provides an ideal natural laboratory in which we will investigate fundamental biological, chemical, and geological processes within the Critical Zone along a gradient of human impacts. We will particularly focus on the sources, transport and fates of water, sediments and carbon from uplands to inland waters and from inland waters to the coastal zone. The CRB/CZO will utilize cutting edge technologies for real-time gathering of hydrological, physical and chemical data and advances in cyber-infrastructure that seamlessly merge real-time data with state-of-the-art graphics tools to provide timely open access to quality controlled data and supporting materials. Field installations and data management advances will enhance an extensive existing network of stations used for monitoring water flow and water chemistry within the CRB basin, including Delaware Coastal Waters, and will build upon a solid foundation of decades of research conducted by UD, SWRC, and numerous state, federal, and non-governmental agencies. The CRB/CZO will serve as a resource to the greater scientific community through open access to data and opportunities for research projects that take advantage of the enhanced monitoring network. The new Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), located at UD, and Delaware's National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) will partner with the CRB/CZO on outreach activities. Public outreach to stakeholders within the Christina Basin is a critical step in making CRB/CZO data available to policy makers. Strong ties between UD and Delaware state agencies will enhance the sharing of environmental data and will provide outreach to the public and to policy makers. Some of our outreach will be coordinated through the Water Resources Agency, part of the UD Institute for Public Administration. The Christina Basin Water Quality Management Committee, which includes representatives from 15 federal, state, and local environmental resource agencies, hosts an annual series of public workshops to identify the science needs of policy makers. We will incorporate science results from the CRB/CZO into these workshops with the goal of providing a direct interface between science and public policy. The SWRC maintains 4 full-time staff members to translate our research into educational programs for middle- and high school-aged students, teachers, and citizen/conservation groups. Graduate students who are involved with the CRB/CZO will be advised by multidisciplinary team of scientists associated with the DENIN and with scientists at SWRC. Collaborations with other academic and federal agency personnel will further enhance interdisciplinary research, student education, and public outreach.</aabstract>

We are developing an interdisciplinary observatory in the southwestern US that will improve our fundamental understanding of the function, structure and co-evolution of biota, soils, and landforms that comprise the Critical Zone (CZ). The observatory is designed as a natural laboratory for the earth science community to test hypotheses related to CZ function in relation to climatic and water cycle variation. We posit that CZ systems organize and evolve in response to open system fluxes of energy and mass that can be quantified at point to watershed scales. These fluxes include meteoric CZ inputs of radiation, water, and carbon that are modulated by surficial biota to produce fluids and biogeochemical components that undergo biotic and abiotic transformation during gradient-driven transport. We hypothesize that the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is related specifically and predictably to the timing and magnitude of these fluxes. Therefore, our CZ Observatory (CZO) is designed to examine the impacts of space-time variability in energy and water flux on coupled CZ processes along two well-constrained climate gradients. The first is on rhyolitic parent material in the Jemez River Basin of northern New Mexico (JRB) and the second is on granite and schist bedrock within the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona (SCM). Measurement, modeling, and experimentation at sites that vary in parent rock, elevation, aspect, slope, soil development, and vegetation will enable quantification of the feedbacks between energy and mass fluxes (driven by chemical and physical gradients) and measured components of CZ structure. Our team has developed an iterative modeling and measurement strategy, and a management structure that fosters integration among disciplines. The JRB-SCM CZO is organized around broad questions that require an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach including the following two: How does variability in energy input and related mass flux influence CZ structure and function? How do feedbacks between landscape evolution and the cycling of water and carbon alter short- and long-term CZ development? To identify the couplings among physical, chemical, and biological processes, our research integrates four crosscutting science themes that are both multi-disciplinary and multi-scale: Ecohydrology and Hydrologic Partitioning, Subsurface Biogeochemistry, Landscape Evolution and Surface Water Dynamics. We are employing an integrated process-based modeling approach to (i) identify optimal sites for measuring structure and process, (ii) refine hypotheses developed through field-based observation and measurements, (iii) explore feedbacks and emergent system behaviors, and (iv) develop transfer functions that can be used to relate system behavior across scales and modes of observation. Discoveries made at the JRB-SCM CZO will improve our ability to predict CZ response to changes in climate and land cover, which is immediately useful to regional resource managers and will ultimately inform broader-scale decision making. We coordinate closely with other CZOs to support data collection, storage, and dissemination. Our education and outreach activities are built upon other highly effective educational efforts developed and led at UA. We are developing a range of products and activities for K-16 students, the general public, and stakeholders, including summer Observatory field experiences for local high school and undergraduate students, graduate courses, and field camps in earth science, as well as coordination of related efforts by other science centers active in the region. We invite new investigators throughout the global earth sciences community to conduct novel and collaborative research at the JRB-SCM CZO.</aabstract>

Geophys. Res., 109, D07S90, doi:10.1029/2003JD003823.</citation>
    <aabstract>The goal of NLDAS is to construct quality-controlled, and spatially and temporally consistent, land-surface model (LSM) datasets from the best available observations and model output to support modeling activities. Specifically, this system is intended to reduce the errors in the stores of soil moisture and energy which are often present in numerical weather prediction models, and which degrade the accuracy of forecasts. NLDAS is currently running in near real-time on a 1/8th-degree grid over central North America; retrospective NLDAS datasets and simulations also extend back to January 1979. NLDAS constructs a forcing dataset from gauge-based observed precipitation data (temporally disaggregated using Stage II radar data), bias-correcting shortwave radiation, and surface meteorology reanalyses to drive several different LSMs to produce model outputs of surface fluxes, soil moisture, and snow cover.

NLDAS is a collaboration project among several groups: NOAA/NCEP's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the University of Washington, the NOAA/NWS Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), and the NOAA/NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). NLDAS is a core project with support from NOAA's Climate Prediction Program for the Americas (CPPA). Data from the project can be accessed from the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) as well as from the NCEP/EMC NLDAS website. 

This service provides access to NASA's North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) hourly Mosaic land surface model data.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Muddy River is located in Brookline and Boston, Massachusetts and is tributary to the lower Charles River. The watershed has drainage area of 6.32 mi2, an average slope of 7.2 percent and mixed land use (46% single family, 14% multi-family, 10%
commercial, 16% urban open, 7% forest, 7% other, USGS). The river has been altered
significantly from its natural form. It is part of the Emerald Necklace park system
designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the late 1800’s. The Muddy River is designated
by the MA DEP as Class B (fishable, swimmable)The Muddy River, like many other urban rivers, has been subject to significant pollution,
including combined sewer discharges, urban runoff discharges, shoreline encroachment,
culverting, etc. Several recent floods have caused significant property damage and recent studies have identified water quality concerns, which lead to the Muddy River Restoration Project.
Northeastern University carried out a 3-year water quality monitoring project. Samples were collected three times per quarter, from 14 stations and analyzed for 36 parameters. Details of the procedures were presented previously in the Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (dated April 13, 2007). The historical data were summarized in a Historical Data Report (dated March 7, 2007). Data, including data quality results and discussion were
submitted on a quarterly basis in 13 Data Reports. The purpose of this final report is to summarize and discuss the data, and to provide recommendations for future studies.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>In 2000, The Nature Conservancy Minnesota Chapter purchased the 10,000 ha Tilden Farms property near Crookston, northwestern Minnesota. During the following decade, the cultivated and grazed lands that comprised the property were restored to perennial prairie and wetland. These lands are now being turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for inclusion and management within the Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge. As reconstructed tracts mature, on-going monitoring reveals the changes in water quality, runoff, and groundwater recharge at selected locations.

    <aabstract>Restoration efforts that remove non-native understory vegetation or dense monotypic stands of non-native vegetation from riparian zones (the bosque) are designed to reduce consumption of water. Quantification of the response of evapotranspiration (ET) and water table depths to non-native understory removal or to eradication of dense stands of non-native species like salt cedar or Russian olive is needed to provide defensible estimates of potential water-savings from restoration activities. In addition to restoration assessment, it is also important to monitor the effects the increasing roles of fire and post-burn management have on ET and water tables. We monitored the ET and water table responses of a site with understory removed (Albuquerque South Valley).</aabstract>

    <aabstract>A portion of the publicly available data from Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory included in HIS for testing and demonstration purposes.  Coweeta is one of the oldest continuous environmental studies in North America, Coweeta is based in the eastern deciduous forest of the southern Appalachian Mountains, and the centerpiece of a long-term cooperation between the University of Georgia and the USDA Forest Service. The Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory is an experimental forest within the USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station.  USFS scientists have monitored streamflow and climate on several gaged watersheds within the Coweeta basin since 1934, and atmospheric deposition and stream chemistry since 1972.   In addition, the Coweeta Hydrologic Lab is a National Science Foundation  LTER site.  The Coweeta LTER has evolved from a site-based to a site- and region-based project centering on the effects of disturbance and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those ecological cycles. The current Coweeta LTER research program, entitled ""Southern Appalachia on the Edge"" focuses on the impacts that exurbanization and climate change are having on water quality, water quantity, and other ecosytem services. </aabstract>
