You must start the service by double-clicking on start_python_service.bat before adding the Muskingum.omi to an OpenMI Configuration.  When you done running the model, simply close the command window running the Python service to terminate the service.  

This Python service requires Python version 2.5 with NetworkX installed.  Both are freely available online  (http://www.python.org, http://networkx.lanl.gov).

NOTE: We have only tested this having the service run on the local host.
