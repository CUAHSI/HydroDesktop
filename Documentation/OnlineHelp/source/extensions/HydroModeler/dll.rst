*Dynamic link library file*.  This file is a compiled library of code used by a computer program.  Each model component in HydroModeler will have an associated dll file that contains the computational engine for that model.  When you run a project in HydroModeler, it will call the model dll files to compute data based on the logic contained within that specific model.
