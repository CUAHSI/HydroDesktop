*.dll file
==========

*Dynamic link library file*.  The primary purpose of these files is to help facilitate the processes of your computer by providing the required functions and data needed from each individual model.  When you run a project from HydroModeler, it will call the model files contained within the project.  The .dll will retrieve the required information from the model components and return it back to the main processes.  Each of these model componenets will have their own .dll files.  The benifits behind using .dll files is so that multiple programs can access a models information as well as speeding up the processes of your computer by running only when its associated model is present in your project.
