HydroModeler is a HydroDesktop plugin that extends its capabilities to include component-based model development. HydroModeler is based off an open-source model editor provided by the OpenMI Association Technical Committee (OATC) Configuration Editor version 1.4. Its integration within the HydroDesktop environment provides the ability to both retrieve data from remote sources and seamlessly utilize it in a model simulation. Using this method, and a small library of components, one can leverage HydroDesktop to build and execute an entire model.

Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI) defines a standard to determine what makes a component OpenMI compliant. If a component is in compliance with OpenMI then it can immediately be used within HydroDesktop. This concept of a standard interface is what allows for specific and comprehensive modeling. HydroDesktop users can bring components from different sources into the software to build specialized models. The development strategy for model components is identical to that outlined in the OpenMI document series which can be found at http://openmi.com . The basic functionality of HydroModeler includes the ability to open and save model compositions, adding and removing components and connections, and executing a model composition.
