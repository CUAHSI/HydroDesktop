Running a Model Composition
===========================

This page will show you how to run your projects and extract the data that is calculated.

1.	Begin by loading your composition into the Hydromodeler plug in.  I will be using example configuration 2 in my images.

2.	Right click in the white space in the Hydrodesktop window and select run.  A dialog box will appear.

3.	This box will allow you to select a variety of options to fine tune the output that will be displayed once you run the project.

4.	If you do not wish to save the output to your computer, skip to the next step.  To log this information to a text document, you will need to click the box to the left of the log to file area of the previously mentioned box.  Now click the button to the right and a window will appear prompting you to choose a file name and location for your text document.  When you are finished here, click save to return to the Run Properties dialog box.

7.	If you created a log file, you can now navigate to the file and open it.  It will contain all of the output that was displayed when you ran your project.
