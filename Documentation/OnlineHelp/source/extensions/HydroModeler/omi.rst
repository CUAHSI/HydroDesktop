*.omi file
==========

*OpenMI model file*.  These will be the models and tools you can use to help compile your projects.  Each of these components will run a different method that will be used to process the desired data you need.  A breif explanation of the methods found in the pre-existing models can be found in the following page.  If you have access to the appropriate programing software, you also have the ability to develop your own model components.
