*.shp file
==========

*Shapefile.*  This file is used to graphically describe your data using points, polylines, or polygons.  A shapefile can be included in your configuration files and subsequently read by the HydroModeler plug in.  A .shp file is not required and is also not the only format that can be used.  An alternative would be to use an ASCII files.  HydroModeler has a build in viewer that can display this graphical representation and is called the ElementSetViewer, which you can find more information about in the Linking Components section of the HydroModeler help files.
