This document is divided into three main sections.  The first section explains the basic concept of HydroModeler by walking you through a sample model configuration.  The second section explains how a new model can be created by altering model inputs.  Finally, the third section provides a description of how to create a model component with a basic explanation of the source code in a sample component.    All source codes are available for viewing and downloading from our repository (http://hydrodesktop.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets) .
