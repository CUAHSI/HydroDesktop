Zooming In and Out On Plots
=====================================================
  
You can easily zoom in and out on a plot within Graph View using the following steps:

1. Create a time series plot by selecting one or more data series in the Series Selection Tool.


.. figure:: ./images/Graph_image004.png
  :align: center 

2. Click and drag rectangle on the plot to define a zoom area.  You will notice that when you hover over the plot the cursor changes to a cross, enabling you to select a zoom area.

3. While you are zoomed in, you will notice that scroll bars appear at the bottom and on the right of the plot window.  You can zoom in on a time series plot and then scroll through time using the scroll bars.
4. To zoom out, you can right click on the plot and select "Un-zoom," "Undo All Zoom/Pan," or "Set Scale to Default."
