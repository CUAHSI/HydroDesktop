Changing the Plot Options
=====================================================
  
Some of the plot types within the Graph View have some options for customizing the look and feel of the plot that is displayed.  Use the following steps to explore the options for each plot type:

1. Select one or more time series from the Series Selection Tool to create a plot in the Graph View.
2. Select the desired plot type from the Graph View Ribbon at the top of the Graph View.  You will notice that a set of options for the selected plot type appears in the Graph View ribbon.
3. Set the options that you want to customize your plot.  The following describe the options for each plot:
	* Time Series and Probability Plots - Using the "Plot Type" button you can set the plot type to show the line, the data points, or both.  Using the "Color Setting" button you can set the colors used to symbolize the lines and points on the plots.  Using the "Close Legend" button you can control whether the legend is shown on the plot or not.
	* Histograms - Using the "Histogram Type" button you can control the type of histogram that is shown. Using the "Binning Algorithms" button you can choose the algorithm used to calculate the histogram bins.
	* Box/Whisker Plots - Using the "Box Whisker Type" button you can choose the time scale for the box/whisker plots (e.g., monthly, seasonal, yearly, or overall).
