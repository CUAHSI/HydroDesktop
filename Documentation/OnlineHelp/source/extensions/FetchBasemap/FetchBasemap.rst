Fetch Basemap
=============

The Fetch Basemap extension in HydroDesktop enables automatic retrieval of online basemap tiles from a variety of tile providers, including ESRI, Bing, and OpenStreetMap.  These basemaps help give context to your spatial and hydrologic data.  The selected basemap is automatically refreshed upon zooming, panning, or otherwise changing the visible extent of the main HydroDesktop map.

Selecting a Basemap Service
---------------------------
Using the Fetch Basemap extension is very easy.  To enable the automatic fetching, simply select the desired basemap service from the dropdown in the **Online Basemap** panel of the **Home** Tab.  To change the basemap service, simply select another option from the dropdown.  The basemap can be turned off by selecting the **'None'** option from the dropdown or by removing the Online Basemap layer from the listing of map layers in the main HydroDesktop map window.

Changing Basemap Opacity
------------------------
The opacity of the basemap can be adjusted using the **Opacity** dropdown in the **Online Basemap** panel.  Setting the basemap to be semi-transparent will allow map layers that fall beneath the basemap to be visible according to which opacity is chosen.  Smaller opacity numbers result in greater transparency of the basemap.
