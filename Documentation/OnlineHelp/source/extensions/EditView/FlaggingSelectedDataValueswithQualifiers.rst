Flagging Selected Data Values with Qualifiers
=====================================================
  
When you edit data values within a data series, you may want to flag them with a qualifying comment that states that the data values have been edited.  Use the following steps to flag selected data values with a qualifying comment:

1. If you have not already, select a data series for editing and click the "Start Editing" button on the Edit View ribbon.
2. Use the data filters or click on records in the Edit View table to select the data values that you would like to add a qualifying comment to.
3. Click on the "Flag" button on the Edit View ribbon.  The following window will open.

4. On this form you can either select a data qualifying comment from the drop down list at the top of the form (in the case that it already exists in the HydroDesktop database), or you can create a new qualifying comment by selecting "New Qualifier" from the drop down list.
5. If you selected "New Qualifier," you need to create a code for your qualifier and a description, which is the text of your qualifying comment.
6. Once you have completed the form by either selecting an existing comment or creating a new one, click the "Set" button to apply the qualifying comment to the selected data values.
