Selecting Data Series to Edit
=====================================================
  
Edit View was designed to enable editing of one data series at a time.  Use the following steps to select a data series for editing:

1. Select a data series in the HydroDesktop Series Selection tool by clicking the check box next to it.  This will create a plot of the data series in the plot portion of the Edit View tab.

2. Once a series is selected, click the "Edit Series" button on the Edit View ribbon.  You will notice that the plot changes and shows the points associated with the selected series.  The data values of the series are also loaded into the tabular view at the bottom of the Edit View tab, and the data filters at the right of the plot are enabled.  The series you have selected is now ready for editing.
