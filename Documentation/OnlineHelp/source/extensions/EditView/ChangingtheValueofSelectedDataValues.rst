Changing the Value of Selected Data Values
=====================================================
  
The Edit View extension provides functions for changing the value of selected data values.  An example of when this functionality could be useful might be when an improper offset has been used in a datalogger program and the values of a data series need to be adjusted.  Use the following steps to change the value of selected data values:

1. If you have not already, select a data series for editing and click the "Start Editing" button on the Edit View ribbon.
2. Use the data filters or click on records in the Edit View table to select the data values that you would like to modify.
3. Click the "Change Value" button on the Edit View ribbon.  The following window will open:

  :align: center 

4. Select the operation that you would like to perform to the selected data values (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, or set value to).
5. Type a numeric value into the text box and then click OK.  In the following example, the Edit View extension will add a value of 20 to the selected data values.
