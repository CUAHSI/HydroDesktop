Inserting Data Values
=====================================================
  
In some cases, you may want to insert one or more data values into an existing data series.  This functionality is useful in filling small data gaps with missing values.  Use the following steps to insert data values into an existing data series:

1. If you have not already, select a data series for editing and click the "Start Editing" button on the Edit View ribbon.
2. Click the "Add Point" on the Edit View ribbon.  The following window will open.

  :align: center 

3. On the third row of the table on this form you can type in the data value that you wish to add and the additional metadata that describe it.  You must input at least values for the DataValue, LocalDateTime, UTCOffset, and DateTimeUTC fields, which are all highlighted in yellow.

4. You can continue adding new values in the final row in the table until your edits are complete.  When you have finished inserting new data values, click the "Add" button to add the new data to your data series.
