Restoring Data Series Values
=====================================================
  
During your editing session, the Edit View extension maintains a copy of the data in memory.  Any editing functions that you perform are made on the memory copy of the data.  The changes that you make to the data will not be saved to the database until you decide to do so.  If you make a mistake and would like to undo your edits, you can click the "Restore Data" button on the Edit View ribbon.  This button will reload the original data series from the HydroDesktop database and will discard any changes that you have made since your last save.
