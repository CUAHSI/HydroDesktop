Run Search
==========

After specifying the **Area**, **Options** and **Keywords** search criteria, click the **Run Search** button.

When running a search, HydroDesktop asks the CUAHSI-HIS national catalog for descriptions of time series that match the selected search criteria. 
At this point, HydroDesktop is using a remote online resource and bringing back data to display in your map. The progress of the search and number of series found is shown.

* Note: If you selected a very large search area or a large number of keywords, then the search may take a long time to complete.

After HydroDesktop has finished searching for time series, 
it displays the locations of time series that fit your search in a map layer called **Search Results.** Note that there will be several **dots** at a single location in the map if the site represented 
by a given dot measures more than one time series that matches the search criteria. In other words, each dot in the map represents a time series of data. 
Different symbols for the dots indicate different data sources. The symbol abberviation are the data source codes. 

Commonly encountered data source codes are:

- **NWISDV**	USGS NWIS Daily Values
- **NWISIID**	USGS instaneous irregular data
- **NWISUV**	USGS Unit values (recent irregular data)
- **NWISGV**	USGS ground water level
- **EPA**		U.S Environmental Protection Agency water quality data
